                <h2>Hey, It's Godswill Ugwu over here.</h2>
                <p>A few months back I wrote my last exam for my BSc. program at the Enugu State University of Science and Technology - Computer Science. Asides my academic pursuits, I have a few hobbies that I've grown a passion over.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Driving</li>
                    <li>Repairing broken stuff</li>
                    <li>Listening to <em>good</em> music</li>
                    <li>Taking nature photography</li> 
                </ul> <br>
                <p>There are more, but in addition to these I'm a web developer and I am enthusiastic about several other things. <br> We'll briefly  take a look at them. <br> But before that, I must say that <a href="https://www.google.com/"> google </a> has truly been a game-changer in so many ways for good, opening doors to knowledge, access to information through research, and connection across the world. </p>
