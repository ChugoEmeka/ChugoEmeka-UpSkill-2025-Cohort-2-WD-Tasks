                I'm Godswill Ugwu, also known as <em>"Chugo" or "Chugo_Repairs".</em> 
                <details>
                    <summary>Chugo?</summary>
                    <p>I derived the name "Chugo" by combining the first two letters of my middle name "Chukwuemeka" and first name "Godswill", and the first letter of my surname "Ugwu", "Ch,U,Go" which forms "Chugo", and is pronounced as "Chew-go".</p>
                </details>
                <br> I have quite a couple of hobbies, I'll make a list to mention them in no particular order.

                So, one might might wonder, why did I or why would I choose web developement? <br> Well, the answer is, Starting out in tech, my ambition has been to transition from one tech stack to another in due time. And guess what? I chose web development for starters.
            </p>
            I hope I don't sound too mystic here, so I'm gonna drop in a picture of myself  to show you the face behind this simple web page, <em>Cheese.</em>

                <h4>
                    So why are we here?
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Well, learning web development might be easy - standalone, but being in a class helps structure ones learning and brings one closer to people with similar goals as well as mentors who have undergone the process and now find themselves in a position to help others.
